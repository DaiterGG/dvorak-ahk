# qwerty-dvorak-ahk  
This is a personal AHK v2 layer for using different layouts on Windows.  
It gives you full control over layout-specific shortcuts.  
Currently:  
wip (potential bugs)  
sub-optimal code  
automatically log active window (by process name) -> current layout
and apply layout when switching active windows
save that dictionary to a file and apply on launch
disables Caps  
caps + zxcv... etc. for one hand shortcuts
win + space to maximize current window
does not support up/down key presses (use Alt + 4 for that)  
works for Windows QWERTY - US  
Alt + 1 programmer DVORAK  
Alt + 2 QWERTY  
Alt + 3 Rus (ЙЦУКЕН)  
Alt + 4 Disable all hotkeys (except caps for muscle memory)
